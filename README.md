# sign_learn
We, team of three students built (tried) a language learning app that helps Users to Learn Sign language from scratch and side by side practising what they have learnt using Practise Button in each level.
Practise button opens the back camera to record and capture user's hand gestures and verifies it with corresponding lesson. For language detection we have used Object detection using pytorch and deployed as a gradio app.
we tried to implement blockchain for reward sytem where rewards are NFTs that will get transferred directly to user's metamask wallet after gaining achievement in the app but we failed implementing this beacause of lack of knowledge.
In Future, after gaining enough knowlegde of blockchain technology we believe we can integrate Aptos blockchain to the app as a reward sytem.
